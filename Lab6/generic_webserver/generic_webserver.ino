   E155 Lab 6 Generic Webserver

   Hosts a webserver displaying webpages sent over UART, sending back redirect URLs to provide a measure of user interaction.

   In more detail:

   1) The webserver starts a 9600 baud serial connection over the hardware UART (for debug)
   2) The webserver starts a 9600 baud software serial connection over pins 2 and 3 (RX, TX)
   3) The webserver connects to a given network, and prints status information over the debug UART. By default, this is CINE.
   4) The webserver waits for a request from the client, after which it sends a string to the MCU: "REQ:" + <abbr. url> + "/REQ"
   5) The webserver waits for the MCU to send over an HTML webpage, defined as "<!DOCTYPE html><html> ... </html>"
   6) The webserver displays this webpage to any connected clients

   steps 4-6 are repeated while the program runs

   Abbreviated URL explanation:
   The webserver automatically parses a client request to simplify code on the MCU. If the server has example IP address '192.168.1.1', a client request may be the URL:
   'http://192.168.1.1/webpage'
   The server will return everything after the IP address and slash. For example:
   'http://192.168.1.1/webpage' => 'REQ:webpage/REQ
