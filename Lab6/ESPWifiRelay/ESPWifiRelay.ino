   E155 Lab 6 Generic Webserver

   Hosts a webserver displaying webpages sent over UART, sending back redirect URLs to provide a measure of user interaction.

   In more detail:

   1) The webserver starts a 9600 baud serial connection over the hardware UART (for debug)
   2) The webserver starts a 9600 baud software serial connection over pins 14 and 15 (RX, TX)
   3) The webserver connects to a given network, and prints status information over the debug UART. By default, this is CINE.
   4) The webserver sends an empty request '<>' to the microcontroller to obtain a copy of the webpage
   5) The webserver initializes an HTTP server and a hardware refresh timer
   6) The webserver waits for a request from the client, after which it transmits an updated webpage

   steps 4-6 are repeated while the program runs

   In parallel, a hardware timer triggers an interrupt every 10 seconds. This will cause a refresh of the webpage from the MCU by
   sending the most recent abbreviated URL to the MCU as "<" + <abbr. url> + ">", and waiting for an updated webpage to be returned
   over UART. This only occurs if the following conditions are met:

   1) The hardware timer interrupt has not been handled, occuring when refreshWebpage = true
   2) A client has requested data from the webpage after the last refresh of the webpage from the MCU. This occurs when webpageUpdated = false

   Abbreviated URL explanation:
   The webserver automatically parses a client request to simplify code on the MCU. If the server has example IP address '192.168.1.1', a client request may be the URL:
   'http://192.168.1.1/webpage'
   The server will return everything after the IP address and slash. For example:
   'http://192.168.1.1/webpage' => '<webpage/>'

   We expect these abbreviated URLs to be under 10 characters
