 *
 * MCU backend for Lab 6. Generates webpages as requested by the ESP8266, and interfaces with the onboard PIO and ADC peripherals to allow user control of an LED and to display the voltage on ADC channel 2.
 * 
 * The LED on PA17 is controlled by the webpage, active low
 * The LED on PA18 is active when the webpage is transmitted to the ESP8266 from the MCU
 *
 * In more detail:
 * 1) The MCU initializes peripherals
 * 2) The MCU loads any incoming bytes from UART into a buffer, and scans for the sequence '< ... >' Held within the angle brackets is the request from the microcontroller. Steps 3-5 are executed if a request is detected
 * 3) The MCU turns on PA17 if 'on' is within the request, and turns off PA17 if 'off' is within the request
 * 4) The MCU reads the CH2 ADC voltage
 * 5) The MCU generates and sends the webpage to the ESP8266 over UART
